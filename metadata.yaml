description: "The Wrong Box is a black comedy novel co-written by Robert Louis Stevenson\
  \ and Lloyd Osbourne, first published in 1889. The story is about two brothers who\
  \ are the last two surviving members of a tontine.\nThe book was the first of three\
  \ novels that Stevenson co-wrote with Osbourne, who was his stepson. The others\
  \ were The Wrecker (1892) and The Ebb-Tide (1894). Osbourne wrote the first draft\
  \ of the novel late in 1887 (then called The Finsbury Tontine), Stevenson revised\
  \ it in 1888 (then called A Game of Bluff) and again in 1889 when it was finally\
  \ called The Wrong Box. A film adaptation, also titled The Wrong Box, was released\
  \ in 1966, and a musical in 2002.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
